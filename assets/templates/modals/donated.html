		When we've validated the payment, you should see your decoration appearing on the drawing on this page. It should be instant, but it could take some time.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you still can't see your decoration after a few hours and it's really bugging you, don't hesitate to contact me. You can find my details at the bottom of the page.
	</p>
	<p>Cheers.</p>
